# Fashion MNIST

Fashion MNIST is a benchmark dataset widely used in the field of computer vision and machine learning. It serves as an alternative to the traditional MNIST dataset, providing a more challenging and realistic task for image classification algorithms. This project aims to explore and solve the Fashion MNIST dataset using various machine learning techniques and models.

## Dataset Description

The Fashion MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 grayscale images of fashion products, with each image belonging to one of the ten different classes. These classes include T-shirts/tops, trousers, pullovers, dresses, coats, sandals, shirts, sneakers, bags, and ankle boots. The images have a resolution of 28x28 pixels, making them suitable for quick experimentation and model training.

## Project Goals

The main goals of this project are:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Perform an in-depth analysis of the Fashion MNIST dataset, including data visualization, understanding class distributions, and identifying any patterns or correlations that can aid in classification.

2. **Model Development**: Develop and compare different machine learning models for image classification using the Fashion MNIST dataset. This may include traditional algorithms such as decision trees, support vector machines, and random forests, as well as more advanced techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the developed models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Compare the results obtained from different models to identify the most effective approach for Fashion MNIST classification.

## Usage
